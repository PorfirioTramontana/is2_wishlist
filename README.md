# Wishlist üõç - IS2 Project

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/antoniopicone/is2_wishlist.svg?style=svg&circle-token=1ccd8f54691c51063304ecb4d2c1e0ee9adc65e2)](https://circleci.com/gh/antoniopicone/is2_wishlist)

Angular based project for Ingengeria del Software 2 exam, focused on capture&amp;replay testing.
This project is written in TypeScript on Angular 8 framework.

## How to

To get started, you need:

- git
- docker
- VSCode (with remote devolpment plugins installed)

## Running our app for the first time

1. Clone this repo in a folder of your machine and open the folder in VSCode.
Once VSCode has started, choose to Reopen in Container the project: VSCode will set up the infrastructure designed in `/docker/docker-compose.yml` and expose on your machine two services on two ports:

    - 3000 for the json-server (a mock server to expose rest API for the client app)
    - 4200 for the Angular client application

   Once VSCode has reopened in container your project, you'll work iside the client app container: opening a terminal in VSCode, ie, will make you operate with bash inside client container, chrooted in `/client` folder of this project (where Angular application lives).

2. From the terminal inside the client container, run `npm start` (or click on the action in VSCode): this will start angular development server on port 4200 (automatically forwarded to your host machine).

3. Starting from 2.0 tag version, you have to signup with your email to access to the application: once the application is up & running, a login/signup form will appear. Your email registration/login will be handled with Firebase Email Auth service provider. 

## Debugging Angular app

As this projects installs Chrome/Firefox remote debugging, **having angular development server running**, switch on Debug section of VSCode and run _Debug in Chrome_.

## Continuous Integration

This project has been configured with CircleCI to:

- check build status
- verify previously injected hooks
- run regression tests (with Protractor)
- build for production
- deploy a __function__ (the mock server) and a __site__ (the Angular app) to Firebase 

In addiction, you can see the build status with badge on top of this document.

## Running end-to-end tests with Robotframework

All test suites should be in subfolders of `/tests` folder: a test suite is composed by `/test-cases` and `/reports`.
In each test suite subfolder should be available a `run-test.sh` bash script running (a dockerized) robot-framework (copy the one available in _example_ test suite subfolder).

## Test hooks

### Injecting hooks

To inject hooks according to this custom locator, you have to run the project in _Remote Development_ mode in VSCode:

```bash
cd /workspace/test-guard
node main.js inject-hooks '../src/**/*.html' --grammar angularjs
```

### Recording test cases and exporting in robot format

All test suites should be recorded with Katalon Recorder plugin for Chrome or Firefox and **exported in Robot format** to be placed in subfolders of `/tests` folder: a test suite is composed by `/test-cases` and `/reports`.
In each test suite subfolder should be available a `run-test.sh` bash script running (a dockerized) robot-framework (copy the one available in _example_ test suite subfolder).

Put each test case file with `.robot` extension in `/tests/<version>/test-cases` folder: each version corresponding to a tag of the repository will be executed during ***c&r-tests*** (Capture & Replay Tests) phase of CircleCI workflow (**TBD**).

### Verifying hooks

To verify hooks, in _Remote Development_ mode in VSCode, just:

```bash
cd /workspace/test-guard
node main.js verify-hooks '../src/**/*.html' --grammar angularjs --suites '../tests/1.0/test-cases'
```

### Running the splitter

To run the splitter script, in _Remote Development_ mode in VSCode, just:

```bash
cd /workspace/test-guard
node test-script-splitter.js --suites '../tests/1.0/test-cases' --dest '../output-locators' --num 3
```
